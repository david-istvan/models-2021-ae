# STATUS

## Why should systematic studies get recognized?
The ability to reproduce an experiment, and to openly access its data is especially crucial in systematic studies. We believe recognizing systematic studies with availability/reproducibility badges will encourage follow-up studies, like ours. The acceptance of this paper justifies our reasoning about the usefulness of processing incrementally surveyed information. This act, however, strongly depends on the quality of the updated/replicated original studies.
