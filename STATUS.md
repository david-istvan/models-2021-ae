## Why should systematic studies get recognized?
The ability to reproduce an experiment, and to openly access its data is especially crucial in systematic studies. We believe recognizing systematic studies with availability/reproducibility badges will encourage follow-up studies, like ours. The acceptance of this paper justifies our reasoning about the usefulness of processing incrementally surveyed information. This act, however, strongly depends on the quality of the updated/replicated original studies.

## The badges we apply for
We are applying for the following badges.
* Artifacts Available
* Artifacts Evaluated – Reusable

## Why does this artifact deserve recognition?
We are applying for these badges for the following reasons.

#### Artifacts Available

We made every data available online at a permanent, publicly available repository, under the GPL-3.0. license. We made a great effort to expose as much data as we had. We provide data about the various stages of our systematic study; data we extracted by processing the corpus; and analysis scripts in R. Furthermore, we provide clear pointers to the original study where our base protocol is located.

#### Artifacts Evaluated – Reusable
We made an effort to make our artifacts reusable. In order to make our raw data reusable, we have used clear identification mechanisms of the units of the study, and provide clear traceability information so that the various data can be linked. In order to make our assessment and analysis process reusable, we have included the analysis scripts that carry out the analysis of the raw data.
